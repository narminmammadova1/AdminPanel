# AdminPanel
📌 Project Overview: Admin Panel (Freelance Request)
This project is a custom-built Admin Panel developed based on a freelance client's request. Through this panel, the admin can manage users and handle metadata for video and audio content.

🧩 Core Features:
Add, edit, and delete users

Add and manage video/audio file information (excluding the actual media files)

Track access duration for each media item with visual indicators

🗂️ Video & Audio Metadata Management:
The actual media files are not uploaded to this admin panel. Instead, the following metadata is managed:

Title

Type

Category

Description

Duration

Thumbnail image (via URL)

This setup is ideal for clients who host media content on external platforms but need a centralized system to manage and organize content details.

⏳ Access Duration Indicator:
Media entries are color-coded based on how much time is left before their access period expires:

🟢 Green: More than 3 days remaining

🟡 Yellow: Exactly 3 days remaining

🔴 Red: Expired content

This helps the admin monitor and update time-sensitive content with ease.
